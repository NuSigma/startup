Learned basics of Git and GitLense plugin for VS Code. Extremely overwhelming amount of information, very confused. So many small buttons, so much text, so many commands.
Ended the lesson with 6 more GitHub pages to read about repositories, forks, and Markdown syntax. Will I read them all? I dunno. Will the tabs stay open on my computer for the majority of the semester "just in case"? Almost certainly.
